== Protection Profile Template

=== Quickstart

[arabic]
. To make a new protection profile create a new repo, probably through
the web interface.
. Copy the URL to the projects git file to the clipboard. Run the
following script, pasting the value copied into where you see
$NEW_REPO_GIT_URL.

....
git clone --bare https://github.com/commoncriteria/pp-template.git
# Make a bare clone of the repository

cd pp-template.git
git push --mirror $NEW_REPO_GIT_URL
# Mirror-push to the new repository

cd ..
rm -rf pp-template.git
# Remove our temporary local repository
....

[arabic, start=3]
. Do a full clone of your new project
. Rename the input file, currently named, input/pp-template.xml to the
name of the project with xml added to it; for example, operatingsystem
and application have operatingsystem.xml and application.xml input files
respectively.
+
If something was the project name it would be,
+
....
git mv input/pp-template.xml input/something.xml
....
. If creating a Protection Profile Module rename Module.make to Makefile
otherwise rename ProtectionProfile.make to Makefile and delete the other
.make file.
. If creating a Protection Profile Module open input/something.xml and
change the opening <PP> and closing </PP> tags to be <Module> and
</Module> respectively. If you’re creating a standard Protection Profile
then these tags do not need to be changed.
. Remove this content from the readme, up to the line below and
customize (look for `QQQQ' and `pp-template').

Note: Adding this project to the Travis CI live build requires special
permission and cannot be done without assistance. Contact the the
framework coordinators for more informatino.
