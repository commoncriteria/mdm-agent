        <h1 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="Introduction">1 Introduction</h1>
        <h2 class="indexable" data-level="2" id="overview">1.1 Overview</h2>
         The scope of the MDM Agent PP-Module is to describe the security functionality of a Mobile Device Management (MDM) Agent in terms of [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PPs: 
        <ul>
            <li>Protection Profile for Mobile Device Management (MDM PP), Version 4.0</li>
            <li>Protection Profile for Mobile Device Fundamentals (MDF PP), Version 3.3</li>
            <li>Protection Profile for General Purpose Operating Systems (GPOS PP), Version 4.3</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
         These Base-PPs are valid because a MDM Agent is either a 3rd party application manufactured by the MDM Server vendor or is a native application deployed on a mobile device.

        <h2 class="indexable" data-level="2" id="targets">1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation</h2>
         The MDM system consists of two primary components: the MDM Server software and the MDM Agent. This PP-Module specifically addresses the MDM Agent. The MDM Agent establishes a secure connection back to the MDM Server, from which it receives policies to enforce on the mobile device. Optionally, the MDM Agent interacts with the Mobile Application Store (MAS) Server to download and install enterprise-hosted applications.
        <br>
        <br>
         A compliant MDM Agent is installed on a mobile device as an application (supplied by the developer of the MDM Server software) or is part of the mobile device's OS.This PP-Module builds on either the MDF PP or the MDM PP. A TOE that claims conformance to this PP-Module must also claim conformance to one of those PPs as its Base-PP. A compliant TOE is obligated to implement the functionality required in the Base-PP along with the additional functionality defined in this PP-Module in order to mitigate the threats that are defined by this PP-Module.
        <br>
        <br>
         This PP-Module shall build on the MDF PP if the TOE is a native part of a mobile operating system. The TOE for this PP-Module combined with the MDF PP is the mobile device itself plus the MDM Agent. If the MDM Agent is part of the mobile device&rsquo;s OS, the MDM Agent may present multiple interfaces for configuring the mobile device, such as a local interface and a remote interface. Agents conforming to this PP-Module must at least offer an interface with a trusted channel that serves as one piece of an MDM system. Conformant MDM Agents may also offer other interfaces, and the configuration aspects of these additional interfaces are in scope of this PP-Module.
        <br>
        <br>
         This PP-Module shall build on the MDM Server PP if the TOE is a third-party application that is provided with an MDM Server and installed on a mobile device by the user after acquiring the mobile device. The distributed TOE for this PP-Module combined with the MDM Server PP is the entire MDM environment, which includes both the MDM Server and the MDM Agent. Even though the mobile device itself is not part of the TOE, it is expected to be evaluated against the MDF PP so that its baseline security capabilities can be assumed to be present. 
        <h3 class="indexable" data-level="3" id="TOEboundary">1.3.1 TOE Boundary</h3>
         Figure 1 shows a high-level example of the PP-Module TOE boundary and its Operational Environment. As stated above, the MDM Agent may either be provided as part of the mobile device itself (shown in red) or distributed as a third-party application from the developer of the MDM Server software (shown in blue).

        </div>
        <br>
         The MDM Agent must closely interact with or be part of the mobile device&rsquo;s platform in order to establish policies and to perform queries about device status. The mobile device, in turn, has its own security requirements specified in the MDF PP. 
        <h2 class="indexable" data-level="2" id="usecase">1.4 Use Cases</h2>
         This PP-Module defines 4 use cases:

        <dl>
            <dt id="usecase1"> [USE CASE 1] Enterprise-owned device for general-purpose enterprise use</dt>

                <span class="description"> An Enterprise-owned device for general-purpose business use is commonly called Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE). This use case entails a significant degree of Enterprise control over configuration and software inventory. Enterprise administrators use an MDM product to establish policies on the mobile devices prior to user issuance. Users may use Internet connectivity to browse the web or access corporate mail or run Enterprise applications, but this connectivity may be under significant control of the Enterprise. The user may also be expected to store data and use applications for personal, non-enterprise use. The Enterprise administrator uses the MDM product to deploy security policies and query mobile device status. The MDM may issue commands for remediation actions. </span>

As in the previous use case, the MDM product is used to establish such policies on mobile devices prior to issuance to users. The device may not be permitted connectivity to any external peripherals. It may only be able to communicate via its Wi-Fi or cellular radios with the Enterprise-run network, which may not even permit connectivity to the Internet. Use of the device may require compliance with usage policies that are more restrictive than those in any general-purpose use case, yet may mitigate risks to highly sensitive information. Based upon the operation environment and the acceptable risk level of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in Section 5 of this PP-Module along with the selections in the Use Case 2 template defined in are sufficient for the high-security use case. </span>

                <span class="description">A personally owned device, which is used, for both personal activities and enterprise data is commonly called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). The device may be provisioned for access to enterprise resources after significant personal usage has occurred. Unlike in the enterprise-owned cases, the enterprise is limited in what security policies it can enforce because the user purchased the device primarily for personal use and is unlikely to accept policies that limit the functionality of the device.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                     However, because the Enterprise allows the user full (or nearly full) access to the Enterprise network, the Enterprise will require certain security policies, for example a password or screen lock policy, and health reporting, such as the integrity of the mobile device system software, before allowing access. The administrator of the MDM can establish remediation actions, such as wipe of the Enterprise data, for non-compliant devices. These controls could potentially be enforced by a separation mechanism built-in to the device itself to distinguish between enterprise and personal activities, or by a third-party application that provides access to enterprise resources and leverages security capabilities provided by the mobile device. Based upon the Operational Environment and the acceptable risk level of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in Section 5 of this PP-Module along with the selections in the Use Case 3 template defined in are sufficient for the secure implementation of this BYOD use case.</span>

                <span class="description">A personally owned device may also be given access to limited enterprise services such as enterprise email. Because the user does not have full access to the enterprise or enterprise data, the enterprise may not need to enforce any security policies on the device. However, the enterprise may want secure email and web browsing with assurance that the services being provided to those clients by the mobile device are not compromised. Based upon the Operational Environment and the acceptable risk level of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in Section 5 of this PP-Module are sufficient for the secure implementation of this BYOD use case.</span>

                             This requirement is to ensure that the transmission of any audit logs, mobile device information data (software version, hardware model, and application versions), and configuration data collected by the MDM Agent and sent from the MDM Agent to the MDM Server, when commanded, or at configurable intervals, is properly protected. This trusted channel also protects any commands and policies sent by the MDM Server to the MDM Agent. Either the MDM Agent or the MDM Server is able to initiate the connection.

                             This requirement is iterated from the MDF PP to indicate the protocols that the MDM Agent can use for a trusted channel. The mobile device is required to perform the mandated cryptographic protocols as in the Base-PP for communication channels mandated in the MDF PP. The ST author must select one of TLS, DTLS, or HTTPS in order to establish and maintain a trusted channel between the MDM Agent and the MDM Server. Only TLS, DTLS, or HTTPS are acceptable for this trusted channel.

         When this PP-Module is used to extend the MDF PP, the TOE type for the overall TOE is still a mobile device. The TOE boundary is simply extended to include the MDM Agent application that runs on the mobile device. This threat protects user data from unauthorized logical access. An attacker would attempt to exploit this threat by first exploiting the T.PHYSICAL, T.FLAWAPP, or T.PERSISTENT threats defined in the Base-PP against the mobile device as a whole, and then using the device itself as an attack vector against any backup data stored on the TOE. This assumption expects that networking services will be available for the TOE to use. This is consistent with the Base-PP because the TOE is installed on a mobile device defined by the Base-PP that provides networking services through various radios. This assumption expects that the TOE&rsquo;s underlying hardware platform is validated against the MDF PP. This is consistent with the Base-PP by definition because the mobile device is within the TOE boundary and evaluated against the MDF PP. This assumption expects that the TOE administrator is trusted and competent in configuring the TSF. This assumption is consistent with the A.CONFIG assumption in the Base-PP which expects the TSF to be configured correctly regardless of the subject performing the configuration. This assumption expects that the TOE user is not willfully negligent or hostile in using the TSF. This assumption is consistent with the A.CONFIG assumption in the Base-PP which expects the TSF to be configured correctly regardless of the subject performing the configuration as well as the A.NOTIFY and A.PRECAUTION assumptions which define baseline expectations for the user&rsquo;s level of responsibility. The Base-PP does not define any OSPs so any OSPs defined by the PP-Module will not conflict with the Base-PP by definition. The Base-PP does not define any OSPs so any OSPs defined by the PP-Module will not conflict with the Base-PP by definition. The Base-PP does not define any OSPs so any OSPs defined by the PP-Module will not conflict with the Base-PP by definition. The Base-PP does not define any OSPs so any OSPs defined by the PP-Module will not conflict with the Base-PP by definition. The Base-PP provides an objective, O.INTEGRITY, that ensures that the integrity of the mobile device is maintained. This objective assists in the implementation of O.INTEGRITY by providing records of administrative activity, which would include actions that could cause the integrity of the mobile device to be lost. This objective supports the implementation of the O.CONFIG objective defined in the Base-PP by specifying an additional method by which the TSF may be configured. This objective extends the Base-PP&rsquo;s O.COMMS objective by ensuring that the communications related to MDM Agent functionality are secured in the same manner as other sensitive data transmitted to/from the mobile device. This objective extends the Base-PP&rsquo;s <a href="#O.STORAGE">O.STORAGE</a> objective by ensuring that the mobile device&rsquo;s data-at-rest protection mechanisms can also be used to secure the MDM Agent and related data. This objective extends the Base-PP&rsquo;s OE.CONFIG objective by expecting that TOE administrators act appropriately when installing or configuring the MDM Agent. This objective extends the Base-PP&rsquo;s OE.NOTIFY and OE.PRECAUTION objectives by setting reasonable expectations for user security behavior. This objective helps mitigate the T.EAVESDROP and T.NETWORK threats defined by the Base-PP by reducing the network exposure of the mobile device. This does not conflict with the Base-PP because the Base-PP does not set specific expectations for the level of security that the enterprise provides, but all use cases from the Base-PP set expectations that the mobile device is used for some enterprise purposes so it is reasonable to expect the enterprise have security controls in place to protect these functions. This objective is suitable because the MDM Agent can reasonably expect the device it has been deployed on to be secure. This objective is suitable because while the Base-PP does not associate any availability metrics with wireless communications, the mobile device will always provide the ability to access a wireless network. This SFR requires the MDM Agent to use a trusted channel defined by FTP_ITC_EXT.1 in the Base-PP to transmit data about its own behavior to the Operational Environment. The Base-PP defines FAU_GEN.1; this PP-Module defines a second iteration to use the same audit mechanism to generate audit records for the MDM Agent&rsquo;s behavior. It may alternatively allow the TSF to generate its own audit trail, which does not impede the MDF from enforcing its own security functionality. The Base-PP defines FAU_SEL.1; this PP-Module defines a second iteration to use the same audit mechanism to select the auditable events to be generated by the MDM Agent. Note that the Base-PP does not mandate this requirement so it is possible that only the MDM Agent portion of the TOE may implement it. In this case, the SFR provides a selection for the MDM Agent to implement its own mechanism to perform this function rather than a platform-provided one. This SFR requires the MDM Agent to record data that it receives from the Operational Environment. It does not need to use any functionality defined in the Base-PP to do this, and doing this does not prevent the enforcement of any security requirements from the Base-PP. This SFR requires the MDM Agent to use a digital signature algorithm to validate data that it receives from the Operational Environment. To do this, the MDM Agent will use the functionality defined by the Base-PP in FCS_COP.1/SIGN. This SFR defines the ability of the MDM Agent to interact with the mobile device to execute the management functions defined by FMT_MOF_EXT.1 in the Base-PP. The Base-PP specifically indicates in FMT_MOF_EXT.1.2 that some management functions may be performed via MDM. This SFR defines the functions performed by the MDM Agent when unenrolled from an MDM. The Base-PP defines unenrollment actions in FMT_SMF_EXT.2, and goes on to note that these actions may be performed &ldquo;perhaps via an MDM agent,&rdquo; so this is expected behavior. This SFR defines the ability of the MDM Agent to store generated audit data in the audit storage provided by the mobile device. The Base-PP defines the capability for audit storage in FAU_STG.1. This SFR defines the ability of the MDM Agent to maintain information about its last successful connection with the environmental MDM Server (i.e., the last successful invocation of the trusted channel for that interface, as defined in FTP_ITC_EXT.1 of the Base-PP). It does not need to use any functionality defined in the Base-PP to do this, and doing this does not prevent the enforcement of any security requirements from the Base-PP. https://github.com/commoncriteria/mdm v4.0 https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=428&amp;id=428

         When this PP-Module is used to extend the MDM PP, the TOE type for the overall TOE is still mobile device management. The TOE boundary is simply extended to include the MDM Agent(s) that reside on individual mobile devices and support the management functionality that the MDM Server component implements. This threat protects user data from unauthorized logical access. If the backup data is stored outside the MDM or the mobile device that it protects, then there is no conflict with the MDM PP since it is a different security boundary. If the backup data is stored either on the MDM or on the protected device, an attacker would attempt to exploit this threat by first exploiting any of the threats that the MDM PP defines (<a href="#T.MALICIOUS_APPS">T.MALICIOUS_APPS</a>, <a href="#T.NETWORK_ATTACK">T.NETWORK_ATTACK</a>, <a href="#T.NETWORK_EAVESDROP">T.NETWORK_EAVESDROP</a>, <a href="#T.PHYSICAL_ACCESS">T.PHYSICAL_ACCESS</a>) depending on where and how the backup data is stored, and then use successful exploitation of one of these threats to attempt to access the backup data itself. This assumption expects that networking services will be available for the TOE to use. This is consistent with the Base-PP because the portion of the TOE defined by the Base-PP runs on a general-purpose operating system or specialized network appliance. The Base-PP does not make any assumptions about the environmental functionality that this PP-Module relies on, so there is nothing in this PP-Module that would contradict it. This assumption expects that the TOE&rsquo;s underlying hardware platform is validated against the MDF PP. This is consistent with the Base-PP because the portion of the TOE defined by the Base-PP runs on a general-purpose operating system or specialized network appliance. The Base-PP does not make any assumptions about the environmental functionality that this PP-Module relies on, so there is nothing in this PP-Module that would contradict it.

The MDM PP contains this same objective with the same purpose. The MDM PP contains this same objective with the same purpose. This objective requires the MDM Agent to use platform key storage to protect secret and private key data.

The MDM PP contains this same objective with the same purpose. The MDM PP contains this same objective with the same purpose. The MDM PP contains this same objective with the same purpose. The MDM PP contains this same objective with the same purpose. This SFR provides the alerts that are received by the MDM Server as per FAU_ALT_EXT.1 in the Base-PP. This SFR requires the MDM Agent to generate audit records of its behavior. The mechanism by which it does this is not relevant to the MDM Server portion of the TOE as they reside on different platforms. The Base-PP defines FAU_SEL.1 as an optional SFR to limit the audit events that are generated by the TSF. This PP-Module adds another iteration that requires the MDM Agent to include this capability by default. This SFR provides information during agent enrollment that is required by the MDM Server to meet the FIA_ENR_EXT.1 requirement defined by the Base-PP. The Base-PP defines an SFR (FMT_POL_EXT.1) that requires the MDM Server to provide digitally signed policies and policy updates to the MDM Agent. <a href="#FMT_POL_EXT.2">FMT_POL_EXT.2</a> completes this transaction by requiring the MDM Agent to accept only signed policies and policy updates. This SFR requires the MDM Agent to interact with the underlying mobile device platform to enforce management functions that are configured by the MDM Server (FMT_SMF.1(1) in the Base-PP). This SFR requires the TSF to define its behavior upon unenrollment from management. Unenrollment from management is a management function that is specified in the Base-PP. This SFR defines the ability of the MDM Agent to store generated audit data in the audit storage provided by the mobile device. This does not impact the Base-PP since it resides on a different platform from the MDM Agent. This SFR defines the ability of the MDM Agent to maintain information about its last successful connection with the environmental MDM Server (i.e., the last successful invocation of the trusted channel for that interface, as defined in FPT_ITT.1(2) of the Base-PP). It does not otherwise impact the Base-PP since it describes behavior that occurs local to the MDM Agent during a period where it is not interacting with the MDM Server.

In this case, <a href="#FIA_ENR_EXT.2">FIA_ENR_EXT.2</a> and FMT_POL_EXT.1 are sufficient to validate that the source of the policy data is identified and authenticated before the policy change is accepted.
